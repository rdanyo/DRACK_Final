<h1>The ProtoSite Rationale:</h1>
<p>Based on the research of the students questionnaire and other discussions our team agreed that the current COMP1950 website was informative, easy to navigate and content was displayed in logical order but at the same time certain improvements could be made such as more useful navigation for easier access to resources, a fresher look, and a better mobile experience.</p>

<h1>Proposed ProtoSite:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Add Search form on top of site for easy access to specific topics.</li>
<li>Main Navigation with drop-down menu moved to the top of page allowing user-friendly access.</li>
<li>Leaving various components such as resources, references, exercises, assignments, code samples within the content but at the same time providing fast access by integrating them into the main navigation section.</li>
<li>Keeping the lecture notes.</li>
<li>Keeping same or similar information architecture as content is already well laid out.</li>
<li>Adding a blog page with up-to-date news, shared articles, posts.</li>
<li>@media query to allow for mobile viewing.</li>
<li>Update the look and feel with fresher, more modern design, different color features as well as imagery without loosing focus on content and readability.</li>
<li>Bigger font size and background color for improved readability.</li>
<li>Create access as resource tool for Alumni students.</li>
<li>For faster and more accessible content update the ProtoSite could easily be transitioned into a CMS but at this point we are not concerned as the client is a highly experienced web developer.</li>
